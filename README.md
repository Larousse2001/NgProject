# Restaurant Website

This project is a restaurant website developed using Angular, with data persistence achieved through Firebase. The website provides an interactive and user-friendly interface for customers to explore the restaurant's menu, make reservations, and get information about the restaurant's services and location.

## Demo Website
https://angular-20679.web.app/auth

## Development Server

To run the development server, follow these steps:

1. Install the Angular CLI globally by running `npm install -g @angular/cli`.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/your-username/restaurant-website.git`.
3. Navigate to the project directory using `cd restaurant-website`.
4. Install the project dependencies by running `npm install`.
5. Set up a Firebase project and obtain the necessary Firebase configuration credentials.
6. Replace the Firebase configuration in `src/environments/environment.ts` with your Firebase project's configuration.
7. Run `ng serve` for a dev server.
8. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` in your web browser to view the restaurant website.
9. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code Scaffolding

To generate a new component, you can use the Angular CLI command `ng generate component component-name`. This will create a new component with the specified name. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module` to generate other Angular elements.

## Build

To build the project for production, run `ng build`. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. You can use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running Unit Tests

To execute the unit tests, run `ng test`. This will run the tests using Karma, a test runner for Angular applications.

## Running End-to-End Tests

To execute the end-to-end tests, run `ng e2e`. This will run the tests using Protractor, an end-to-end testing framework for Angular applications.

## Further Help

If you need further help with the Angular CLI, you can use the command `ng help` or refer to the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page for detailed information.
